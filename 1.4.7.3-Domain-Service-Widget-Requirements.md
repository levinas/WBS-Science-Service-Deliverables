Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of widgets. We will use checkboxes to track the progress on viewer
implementation (most of the viewers already exist). The progress on
upload/download widgets is tracked separately in the data
upload/download document linked below.

### Domain contig browser widget

Display domain annotations on contig view.

Requires support of DomainAnnotation and Genome objects.

Optional for Feb: Eventually this display should support multiple
tracks for related species.

### Domain annotation table widget

A browsable and searchable table view of domain annotations for a
given genome (Genome object).

Requires support of DomainAnnotation and Genome objects.

Optional for Feb: Eventually this should support tabs for
results of different domain classifications.

### Viewers

- [ ] domaincontig: displays domain annotations in context of genome contig
- [ ] domaintable: interactive table of domain annotations
